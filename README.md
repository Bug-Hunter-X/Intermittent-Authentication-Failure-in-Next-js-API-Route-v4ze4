# Intermittent Authentication Failure in Next.js API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where API route authentication in Next.js using `unstable_getServerSession` fails intermittently. Even when a user is successfully logged in, the session sometimes returns null, resulting in unauthorized access errors.

## Problem

The API route attempts to verify user authentication using `unstable_getServerSession`.  However, due to potential race conditions or asynchronous behavior, the session check may fail to detect the active session, leading to intermittent 401 errors.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing a more robust retry mechanism.  This ensures that the authentication check is performed again if the initial attempt fails.
